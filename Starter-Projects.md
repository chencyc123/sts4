Describes various wizards for creating Spring Boot Starter Projects and modifying a project's 'starter' dependencies.

# New Spring Starter Wizard

This Wizard use the [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) webservice to generate a Spring Boot Starter project. The project is imported into your workspace.

## Known Limitations

Although the wizard has a 'Language' pull-down allowing to choose Java / Kotlin / Groovy only the Java language is supported. Projects for Kotlin and Groovy *can* be generated but tooling to work with these languages is not included with STS. You can attempt to install Eclipse plugings to work with Kotlin / Groovy but the wizard has not been designed to handle such projects specifically and does not attempts to configure the imported project to work correctly with Kotlin or Groovy.
