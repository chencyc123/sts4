## Known limitations

* JDK9:
  * the Eclipse distribution comes with coding support for JDK9, but the Spring tooling in the background doesn't fully handle JDK9 source code yet
  * also running on top of a JDK9 (have JAVA_HOME set to a JDK9) can cause issues, we suggest to run on JDK8 for now.
* JDK8:
  * JDK 1.8.0_060 and above are required for some features of [Spring Boot Java Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-boot-java)
