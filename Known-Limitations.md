## Known limitations

* Scalability:
  * the tooling is not yet optimized to work well with larger workspaces, especially for many open files from many different projects. This limitation is specific to the Eclipse/Spring Tool Suite 4 environment.

* JDK9:
  * the Eclipse distribution comes with coding support for JDK9, but the Spring tooling in the background doesn't fully handle JDK9 source code yet
